            gcd_rescue: gcd_rescue: Path to a GCD file that will be used if no GCD file is
                        found in subfolder. `I3Reader` will recursively search
                        the input directory for I3-GCD file pairs. By IceCube
                        convention, a folder containing i3 files will have an
                        accompanying GCD file. However, in some cases, this
                        convention is broken. In cases where a folder contains
                        i3 files but no GCD file, the `gcd_rescue` is used
                        instead.
            extractors: The `Extractor`(s) that will be applied to the input
                        files.
            outdir: The directory to save the files in.
            icetray_verbose: Set the level of verbosity of icetray.
                             Defaults to 0.
            index_column: Name of the event id column added to the events.
                          Defaults to "event_no".
            workers: The number of CPUs used for parallel processing.
                         Defaults to 1 (no multiprocessing).
            i3_filters: Instances of `I3Filter` to filter PFrames. Defaults to
