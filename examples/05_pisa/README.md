# PISA examples

Be aware that the examples in this folder presuppose that GraphNeT is installed with [PISA](https://github.com/icecube/pisa).
In addition, it should be noted that the use of PISA is a highly specialised case, albeit an important one for neutrino oscillation physics in IceCube, and that any oscillation analysis example would require an amount of statistics that is not feasible to bundle with a software package like GraphNeT.
For these reasons, examples in this folder are intentionally not self-contained, in contrast to the other provided examples.
However, the GraphNeT developers are happy to work with users who are interested in leveraging the PISA functionality that is included in this package.
